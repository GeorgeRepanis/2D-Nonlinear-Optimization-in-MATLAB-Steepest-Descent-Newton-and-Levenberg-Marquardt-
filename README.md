# 2D-Nonlinear-Optimization-in-MATLAB-Steepest-Descent-Newton-and-Levenberg-Marquardt-
MATLAB implementation and comparison of 2D unconstrained optimization methods on the nonlinear test function   including Steepest Descent, Newton’s method, and Levenberg–Marquardt. Each method is tested with constant step size, exact line search , and Armijo backtracking, with multiple initial conditions.
